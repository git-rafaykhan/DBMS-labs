# ðŸ“˜ DBMS Assignments â€“ University Management System

Welcome to my DBMS Assignments repository! This folder contains detailed coursework, ER diagrams, and schema designs based on a University Management System. These assignments were created as part of my academic journey to understand and implement real-world database design concepts.

## ðŸ“Œ Contents

- **Assignment 1: Comparative Study of Modern Database Systems**
  - A comprehensive comparison of SQL vs. NoSQL databases
  - Includes case studies and usage analysis of MySQL, MongoDB, and Cassandra
- **Assignment 2: University Management System (ER Model + Relational Schema)**
  - Full ER diagram
  - Corresponding relational schema with primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints
  - Design rationale and documentation

## ðŸ“Š ER Diagram Preview

The diagram illustrates how these entities relate, including many-to-many relationships and associative tables like `Student_Enrollment` and `Instructor_Schedule`.
